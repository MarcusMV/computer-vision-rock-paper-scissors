# Computer Vision RPS
## Milestone 1
* Create an image project model from Teachable-Machine with four different classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nothing. Each class is trained with images of yourself showing each option to the camera. The "Nothing" class represents the lack of option in the image. The more images trained with, the more accurate the model.

* Download the model from Tensorflow tab in Teachable-Machine: keras_model.h5, labels.txt. The files contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model.
